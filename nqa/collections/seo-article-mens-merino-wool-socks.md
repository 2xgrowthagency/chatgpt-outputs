## What is Merino Wool?

Merino wool is a high-quality, natural fiber that comes from Merino sheep. It's known for its softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties, making it the perfect material for socks. Merino wool is also naturally anti-bacterial, which means it helps to prevent odors from developing.

### Anti-Bacterial Properties
