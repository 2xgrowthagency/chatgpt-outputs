## What is Merino Wool?

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are bred for their fine and soft wool. Merino wool is known for its exceptional quality, durability, and comfort. It is also naturally anti-odor, moisture-wicking, and temperature-regulating, making it the perfect material for socks.
