Merino wool is a natural fiber that comes from Merino sheep. It's known for its softness, durability, and moisture-wicking properties. Unlike traditional wool, Merino wool is incredibly fine and doesn't itch or irritate the skin. It's also naturally anti-bacterial, which means it helps prevent odors from forming in your socks.
