Our socks are designed with your comfort in mind, using premium materials that reduce foot pain and fatigue while keeping your feet dry and odor-free.

## What Makes Merino Wool Socks So Special?

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, known for their soft and fine wool fibers. Unlike traditional wool, Merino wool is incredibly soft and comfortable, making it perfect for socks. It's also naturally moisture-wicking, meaning it can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture without feeling wet. This makes it perfect for keeping your feet dry and odor-free, even during intense physical activity.
