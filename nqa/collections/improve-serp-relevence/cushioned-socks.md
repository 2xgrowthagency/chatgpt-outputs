##How to Care for Your Cushioned Socks
To ensure the longevity of your cushioned socks, we recommend washing them in cold water and air-drying them. This practice will keep your feet cool, dry, and comfortable, even in warmer weather. Avoid using bleach or fabric softeners, as they can damage the performance materials and reduce the cushioning for comfort.
