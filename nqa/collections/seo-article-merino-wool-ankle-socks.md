## What Makes Merino Wool Ankle Socks So Great?

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their soft and fine wool fibers. The wool is naturally moisture-wicking, which means it can absorb moisture without feeling wet or clammy. This makes it an ideal material for socks, as it helps to keep your feet dry and comfortable throughout the day.
