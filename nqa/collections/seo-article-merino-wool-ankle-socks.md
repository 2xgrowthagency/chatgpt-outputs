Our socks are designed to provide ultimate comfort and support for your feet, while also being anti-odor and made with premium materials.

## What Makes Merino Wool Ankle Socks So Special?

### Merino Wool: The Ultimate Material for Socks

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their fine, soft wool. Merino wool is a popular material for socks because it is naturally moisture-wicking, meaning it can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture without feeling wet. This makes it perfect for socks, as it helps to keep your feet dry and comfortable.

### Cushioning for Your Feet

Our Merino Wool Ankle Socks are designed with cushioning in mind. The extra padding in the heel and toe areas helps to reduce foot pain and fatigue, making them perfect for long days on your feet.
