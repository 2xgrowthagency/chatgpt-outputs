## What are Anti Odor Socks?

Anti odor socks are designed to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi that cause foot odor. They are made with special materials that wick away moisture and keep your feet dry. These socks are perfect for people who are on their feet all day or who suffer from excessive sweating.

## How do Anti Odor Socks Work?

Anti odor socks work by using special materials that prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi. These materials include silver, copper, and zinc. When these materials come into contact with sweat, they release ions that kill bacteria and fungi. This prevents the growth of odor-causing microbes and keeps your feet smelling fresh.
