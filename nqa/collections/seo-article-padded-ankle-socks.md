## What are Padded Ankle Socks?

Padded Ankle Socks are socks that have extra cushioning in the sole and heel areas. This extra padding provides additional support and comfort to your feet, reducing the impact of each step and reducing foot fatigue. Our Padded Ankle Socks are made with premium materials, including merino wool and premium combed cotton, making them soft, breathable, and moisture-wicking.
