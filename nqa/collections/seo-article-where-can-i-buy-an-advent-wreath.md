## Introduction

## The Symbolism of the Advent Wreath

Before we dive into our collection of advent wreaths, let's take a moment to discuss the symbolism behind this beautiful decoration. The advent wreath is typically made up of four candles, each representing one of the four weeks of Advent. The candles are lit in succession, with one candle being lit each week leading up to Christmas.

The wreath itself is typically made up of evergreen branches, which symbolize eternal life. The circular shape of the wreath represents God's infinite love for us, with no beginning or end.
