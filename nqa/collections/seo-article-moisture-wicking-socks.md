## What are Moisture Wicking Socks?

Moisture-wicking socks are specially designed to pull moisture away from your feet and into the fabric of the sock, where it can evaporate. This process helps to keep your feet dry and comfortable, reducing the risk of blisters, foot odor, and other foot-related issues.
