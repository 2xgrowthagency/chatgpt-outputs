## Why Choose Cotton Socks?

Cotton is a natural fiber that is known for its softness, durability, and breathability. Unlike synthetic materials, cotton allows air to circulate around your feet, keeping them cool and dry. Cotton socks, especially cotton ankle socks and cotton dress socks, are also hypoallergenic, making them a great choice for people with sensitive skin. Plus, cotton is easy to care for and can be machine washed and dried.
