## What is Merino Wool?

Merino wool comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their soft and fine wool fibers. Unlike traditional wool, merino wool is lightweight, breathable, and moisture-wicking, making it the perfect material for socks. Merino wool is also naturally anti-odor, so you can wear our socks all day without worrying about unpleasant smells.

Merino wool is naturally moisture-wicking, which means it pulls moisture away from your skin and helps to keep your feet dry. This is especially important for athletes or anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet.

### Temperature Regulation

Merino wool is also great at regulating body temperature. It keeps your feet warm in cold weather and cool in warm weather, making it the perfect material for year-round wear.
