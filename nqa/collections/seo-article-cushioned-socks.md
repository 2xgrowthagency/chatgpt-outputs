## Premium Materials for Maximum Comfort

We believe that the key to comfortable socks is in the materials. That's why we use only the highest quality materials in our Cushioned Socks collection. Our crew and ankle length socks are made with merino wool, a natural fiber that is known for its softness, breathability, and moisture-wicking properties. Our premium combed cotton socks are available in a variety of colors, including red, green, black, white, and grey, and are designed to be both durable and comfortable.

## Anti-Odor Technology for Fresh Feet

Nobody likes smelly feet, which is why we've incorporated anti-odor technology into our Cushioned Socks. Our socks are treated with a special formula that prevents the growth of odor-causing bacteria, so your feet stay fresh and clean all day long.
