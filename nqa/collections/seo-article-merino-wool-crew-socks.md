## What Makes Merino Wool So Special?

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their fine, soft wool. Unlike traditional wool, merino wool is incredibly soft and comfortable, making it perfect for socks. It's also naturally moisture-wicking, which means it can help keep your feet dry and odor-free.
