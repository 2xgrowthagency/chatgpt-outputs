## What Makes Merino Wool So Special?

Merino wool is a type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their soft, fine wool. Unlike traditional wool, Merino wool is incredibly soft and comfortable, making it the perfect material for socks. It's also naturally moisture-wicking, meaning it will keep your feet dry and comfortable all day long.
