## What Makes Merino Wool So Special?

Merino wool is a unique type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, known for their fine and soft wool fibers. Unlike traditional wool, Merino wool is incredibly soft and comfortable to wear, making it the perfect material for socks. Merino wool is also naturally moisture-wicking, meaning it can absorb sweat and keep your feet dry and comfortable all day long.
