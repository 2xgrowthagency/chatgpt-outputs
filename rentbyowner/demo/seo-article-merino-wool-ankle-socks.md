## What is Merino Wool?

Merino wool comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their fine, soft wool. Merino wool is not only soft and comfortable, but it also has natural moisture-wicking and temperature-regulating properties. This means that your feet will stay dry and comfortable in any weather.

### Warmth

Merino wool is also great at keeping your feet warm. Our socks are perfect for cold weather or for anyone who has cold feet.

### Moisture-wicking

Merino wool is naturally moisture-wicking, which means that it will keep your feet dry and comfortable even if you sweat.

### Temperature-regulating

Merino wool is also great at regulating your body temperature. This means that your feet will stay comfortable in any weather, whether it's hot or cold.

### Anti-odor

Our Merino Wool Ankle Socks are also anti-odor, which means that your feet will stay fresh and clean even after a long day of wearing them.
