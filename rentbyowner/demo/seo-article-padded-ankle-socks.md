## What are Padded Ankle Socks?

Padded ankle socks are a type of sock that features extra padding in the sole and heel areas. This padding helps to absorb shock and reduce pressure on your feet, making them ideal for activities like running, hiking, or simply standing for long periods of time.

## Benefits of Padded Ankle Socks

There are many benefits to wearing padded ankle socks, including:

### Increased Comfort

The extra padding in these socks provides a cushioned layer between your feet and your shoes, reducing the impact of each step and making your feet feel more comfortable.

### Improved Support

The added support in the sole and heel areas of these socks can help to reduce the risk of injury and provide extra stability during physical activities.

### Moisture-Wicking

Many of our padded ankle socks are made with moisture-wicking materials, which help to keep your feet dry and prevent blisters and other foot irritations.
