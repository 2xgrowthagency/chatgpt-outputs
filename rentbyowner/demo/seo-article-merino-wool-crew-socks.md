## What Makes Merino Wool So Special?

Merino wool is a unique type of wool that comes from Merino sheep, which are known for their soft and fine wool fibers. Unlike traditional wool, Merino wool is incredibly soft and comfortable to wear, making it the perfect material for socks. It also has natural moisture-wicking properties, which means it can absorb sweat and keep your feet dry and odor-free.
