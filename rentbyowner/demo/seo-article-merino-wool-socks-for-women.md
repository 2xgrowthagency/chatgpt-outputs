## What Makes Merino Wool Socks So Special?

Merino wool is a natural fiber that is known for its softness, breathability, and warmth. Unlike other types of wool, Merino wool is not scratchy or itchy, making it perfect for socks. Merino wool also has natural moisture-wicking properties, which means that it can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture without feeling wet.
