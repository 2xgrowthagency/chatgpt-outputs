## What is Ecommerce Marketing?

Ecommerce marketing refers to the strategies and tactics used to promote and sell products online. It involves a range of activities, including search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, social media marketing, email marketing, and more. The goal of ecommerce marketing is to drive traffic to your website, convert visitors into customers, and increase sales and revenue.

## Why Hire an Ecommerce Marketing Agency?
