2. Polymer Clay: Polymer clay is a popular choice for sculpting as it's easy to work with and comes in a variety of colors. It's also very durable once baked, making it ideal for creating jewelry or other small items.

3. Oil-Based Clay: This type of clay is often used by professional sculptors as it's very pliable and can be reused multiple times. It's also great for creating intricate details as it doesn't dry out.
